# Project 1 - Design a Hash Table

1. Design a hash table (**get()**, **put()**, **remove()** methods). Hash Collisions are handled by using **chaining** with any of the below data structures: 
  * Doubly Linked List 
  * Binary Search Tree 
  * Red Black Tree (Balanced BST) - *Work in progress*
2. Design an LRU cache with eviction policy to remove the least recently used element when it is full:
  * Using Java LinkedHashMap
  * Using Linked List and Hash Table
3. Design a thread-safe cache
